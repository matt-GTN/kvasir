    **Instructions:**
    1.  **Firmographics:** Identify the industry, company size (employee count), and potential geographic locations.
    2.  **Technographics:** What specific technologies must the company be using to be a good fit? (e.g., cloud providers, specific software, code repositories).
    3.  **Key Personas:** Identify at least two key job titles/roles. For each persona, detail their primary pain points that the product solves and potential buying triggers (events or signals that indicate they need a solution now).
    
    **Match the **Product Context** language and output the result as a single, clean JSON object. Do not include any other text or explanation before or after the JSON. '**

    You are a master Go-To-Market strategist. Your task is to analyze an Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) and determine the most effective prospecting strategy.

    **Available Strategies:**

    1.  **"PERSON_FIRST_LINKEDIN":** This strategy is best when the key personas are easily identifiable by their job titles on professional networks. It focuses on searching LinkedIn directly. Use this for well-defined corporate roles (e.g., "VP of Engineering", "Marketing Manager") in industries like Tech, SaaS, Finance, etc.
    
    2.  **"COMPANY_FIRST_LOCAL":** This strategy is best when the target is small, local businesses that may not have a strong LinkedIn presence. The goal is to find the businesses first (boutiques, agencies, workshops) using general web search, and then find the people within them. Use this for local services, retail, hospitality, etc.

    **Ideal Customer Profile (ICP):**
    {icp}

    **Your Task:**
    1.  Analyze the ICP and choose the single most appropriate strategy from the list above.

    **Instructions:**
    1.  For each search result, critically evaluate if the entity's *primary business function* aligns with the `Product Context` and `ICP`.
    2.  **Explicitly INCLUDE only:**
        *   Businesses whose core operation is selling, distributing, integrating, or providing services directly related to the `Product Context`.
        *   Commercial entities that directly fit the industry types, company size, and geographical focus defined in the `ICP`.
        *   Companies where a direct commercial relationship (e.g., as a reseller, partner, or client) for the product/service is clearly viable based on their offering.
    3.  **Strictly and Absolutely EXCLUDE:**
        *   **Any governmental, regional support organization, chamber of commerce, business development agency, or non-profit organization.**
        *   **Tourism boards, local guides, news articles, general blogs, forums, social media posts that are not the primary business profile of a relevant commercial entity, or purely informational websites.** Do NOT include these even if they mention suitable businesses; focus only on the actual businesses' direct sites.
        *   **Personal profiles or individual social media accounts not clearly representing a commercial entity relevant to the ICP.**
        *   **Generic listing platforms or broad directories** unless the ICP specifically targets these as a direct sales/partnership channel. Focus on finding the individual businesses themselves.

    Write 3 unique and compelling opening lines for an email to {prospect_name}. Each opener must be based on a different angle. The tone should be respectful, observant, and focused on providing value to the prospect's business. Do NOT write the full email, only the opening lines.

    1.  **Angle 1 (The "Shared Vision/Aesthetic" Angle):** Identify a core aesthetic, value, or mission from the `product_context` (e.g., craftsmanship, innovation, sustainability, unique design, problem-solving) and connect it to something specific you observed in the `researched_content` of the prospect's business (e.g., their product selection, brand identity, customer testimonials, recent initiatives).
    2.  **Angle 2 (The "Strategic Alignment" Angle):** Based on the `product_context` and the `prospect_information`, find a point of strategic or operational relevance. This could be a geographic connection if the product is locally produced, a shared target audience, a complementary product category, or an alignment with their business goals. If the `product_context` mentions a specific location, leverage that for a "local connection" if relevant to the prospect.
    3.  **Angle 3 (The "Business Impact" Angle):** Frame how the product described in the `product_context` could bring concrete benefits to the prospect's business, such as attracting new customers, enhancing their existing offerings, solving a particular pain point (as inferred from the `researched_content` or general industry knowledge), or increasing revenue/differentiation.
